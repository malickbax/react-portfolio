				<p>
				Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I am a Full Stack Developer based in Arlington, Virginia. 
				While my work in tech focuses on the Front End, I do possess a good working knowledge of the Back End. Previously, I worked in International Security sector in the Washington, DC area and gained a solid experience in Project Management, which provides a unique perspective when working in development teams using Agile methodology. 
				I love solving problems, debugging, troubleshooting, designing and implementing solutions to complex issues.
